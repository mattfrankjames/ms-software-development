1. This took me around 45 minutes across both exercises.
1. The easiest part of this for me was getting the values for the `ball_filler.py` program and assigning them to the appropriate variables.
1. The most challenging part for me was that I somehow missed needing to subtract the core volume from the total volume of the ball so I spent most of my time debugging that program before I finally realized the piece I was missing.
