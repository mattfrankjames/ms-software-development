    <h1>Svelte Kit is the successor to Sapper</h1>
    <p>Prior to this year, if you wanted to build a highly perfomant, full featured web app featuring server side rendering and file based routing with <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a> as the underlying view library, you would need to use <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>. However, at the beginning of the year, <a href="https://youtu.be/qSfdtmcZ4d0">Rich Harris announced that Sapper would never make it to version 1.0</a> and announced a new initiative called <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>.</p>
    <p>Now, SvelteKit is approaching a full release and, while still in beta, can provide us with the next level of developer experience for Svelte developers.</p>
    <p>Already, there are a lot of great resources for <a href="https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/svelte-kit">learning SvelteKit</a> and there are even official guides for <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/migrating">migrating Sapper apps to SvelteKit</a>. So, while the project is <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/faq">still in beta</a>, it is a great time to get familiarized with SvelteKit so you can be ready to jump in with both feet once version 1.0 is officially launched.</p>
