I work for a company called Upland Software, specifically on the Second Street platform product. Our database structure is setup with five highly powered SQL databases that our currently hosted on our own servers. There are also five development servers which house the records for our legacy platform. When new content is added to the live dbs, they are synced with the dev databases. While we have used SQL since the start of our platform, we are working to move our databases from our own servers to AWS. In the process of doing that, our individual servers will be less powerful than we have now, but there will be many more of them. So, while we are scaling down on power per server, we are scaling out on volume of servers.

We have our live databases sectioned out in a way that is designed to support our legacy platform on one database, our current promotions platform on another, our email and messaging campaign is housed on a third database and a fourth is reserved for logging due to the high volume of activity on our main databases. The fifth DB in rotation acts as a backup.

It will be interesting to see what the effect of our move to AWS will be on the overall performance of our platform.
